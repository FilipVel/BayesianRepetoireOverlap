Welcome to an interactive Jupyter Book for the research paper by Daniel B. Larremore entitled "[*TBayes-optimal estimation of overlap between
populations of fixed size*](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006898)".


This Jupyter Book lets you interact with a [demo of their code](https://github.com/dblarremore/BayesianRepertoireOverlap/). You can change the code by inline on the pages or launch a MyBinder session to run your code in a Jupyter Notebook in another tab. The figures are made interactive using [Plotly](https://plotly.com).
