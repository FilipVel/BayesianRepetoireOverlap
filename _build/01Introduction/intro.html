<p>Welcome to an interactive Jupyter Book for the research paper by Daniel B. Larremore entitled "<a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006898"><em>TBayes-optimal estimation of overlap between
populations of fixed size</em></a>".</p>
<p>This Jupyter Book lets you interact with a <a href="https://github.com/dblarremore/BayesianRepertoireOverlap/">demo of their code</a>. You can change the code by inline on the pages or launch a MyBinder session to run your code in a Jupyter Notebook in another tab. The figures are made interactive using <a href="https://plotly.com">Plotly</a>.</p>
